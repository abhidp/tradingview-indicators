# ASRS Strategy Checklist

---

## 🔍 **Strategy Summary: Advanced School Run Strategy (ASRS)**

**Instrument**: German DAX Index
**Timeframe**: 5-minute chart
**Focus**: The **4th 5-minute candle** after the official DAX cash open (9:00 AM Frankfurt time)

### 🔑 Core Concept

- **Trade breakouts** from the 4th 5-minute candle’s range.
- **Buy** if price breaks above the 4th bar high + buffer.
- **Sell short** if price breaks below the 4th bar low – buffer.
- **Stop loss** is always placed at the opposite breakout level (tight risk).
- **No fixed profit target**; manage trades manually.

## ✅ **Trade Entry Checklist for ASRS**

### 🔁 **PRE-MARKET PREP (Before DAX open)**

- [ ] Confirm local time equivalent of **Frankfurt 9:00 AM**.
- [ ] Open the **5-minute chart** for the DAX index.
- [ ] Mark the **first 4 candles** after the open:

  - Candle 1: 9:00–9:05
  - Candle 2: 9:05–9:10
  - Candle 3: 9:10–9:15
  - **Candle 4**: 9:15–9:20 → This is your **signal candle**.

### 📊 **TRADE SETUP (After 4th candle closes)**

- [ ] Note the **high** and **low** of the 4th candle.
- [ ] Calculate entry levels:

  - **Buy stop**: High of 4th bar **+ 2 points**
  - **Sell stop**: Low of 4th bar **– 2 points**

- [ ] Set both pending orders.
- [ ] **Stop loss** = Opposite breakout level

  - If long, SL = short entry level
  - If short, SL = long entry level

- [ ] **No target**: manage trade manually, e.g., trailing stop, partial exits, breakeven move, etc.

### ⚠️ **TRADE MANAGEMENT RULES**

- [ ] **Enter only once per side** per setup (unless you've predefined a re-entry rule).
- [ ] If both long and short get triggered (i.e., whipsaw), manage risk strictly.
- [ ] On **very small 4th candle ranges** (low volatility days), consider waiting for the **5th bar** (9:20–9:25) before placing trades.
- [ ] Avoid trading setups **after 2 hours** of the DAX open—strategy is optimized for early market activity.

### 🧠 **MINDSET & DISCIPLINE REMINDERS**

- [ ] Accept **losses quickly** and unemotionally.
- [ ] Trade small enough not to trigger fear.
- [ ] Do **not deviate** from the plan based on feelings.
- [ ] No after-the-fact regret or rule-bending.
- [ ] Recognize **psychological biases** (e.g., fear of losing profits, hope of recovery).
